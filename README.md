- ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I go by Chris, or Rock Hard Rod, I like to move weights around ocassionally , learn and do "computer stuff" either breaking or fixing (sometimes both), coffee and tequila or tequila 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things offensive security, counter-whatever, I just dislike bad computer people. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning malware development, researching advanced evasion techniques and how defenders can detect stuff.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 867-5309 ; project a white light in the night sky with a silhouette of the Linux penguin ; or by looking in the mirror in your bathroom with the lights off and yelling "cyber chris" three times with closed eyes
