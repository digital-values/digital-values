I like to move heavy weights around ocassionally , learn and do "computer stuff" either breaking or fixing (sometimes both), coffee and tequila or just tequila
I’m interested in all things offensive / counter-whatever in any field/industry
I’m currently learning malware development and advanced malware evasion techniques
