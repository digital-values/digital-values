I like to move heavy weights around ocassionally , learn and do "computer stuff" either breaking or fixing (sometimes both), coffee and tequila or just tequila 
I’m interested in all things offensive / counter-whatever, I just dislike bad people. 
I’m currently learning malware development, advanced evasion techniques, and how defenders can detect stuff.
How to reach me: 867-5309 > project a white light in the night sky with a silhouette of the Linux penguin > or by looking in the mirror in your bathroom with the lights off and yelling "cyber chris" three times with closed eyes
