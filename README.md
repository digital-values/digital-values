Security researcher and self-proclaimed terrible developer with a relentless curiosity about the intricate dance between offense and defense in the cyber realm. 
I find meaning in breaking things apart to deeply understand themâ€”then attempting to craft robust defenses to withstand tomorrow's threats. Inspired by Terry Davis's wisdom, I believe, "The purpose of life is to entertain God."

### What I'm Working On:

- Detection Engineering, mostly against AV using advanced threat hunt queries across SPL, KQL, CQL
- macOS Security Research stuff
- Exploit Development and Advanced Malware Evasion TTPs
- Developing personal tooling for making life as efficient as possible

### Interests & Hobbies

- Security research (both offensive and defensive)
- Privacy related stuff
- Physical security stuff
- Exercise and health stuff
- The endless quest for grilling the perfect steak

### Current Focus

Deep exploration into malware development and evasion techniques to illuminate modern threat landscapes and strengthen defensive readiness.

### Let's Connect

Actually, let's not connect digitally-but if our paths cross at a conference, I'm always eager to exchange ideas and share insights.
