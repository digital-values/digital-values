## About

Security researcher and self-proclaimed terrible developer with a relentless curiosity about the intricate dance between offense and defense in the cyber realm. 
I find meaning in breaking things apart to deeply understand them—then attempting to craft robust defenses to withstand tomorrow's threats. Inspired by Terry Davis's wisdom, I believe, "The purpose of life is to entertain God."

## What I'm Working On:

Malware analysis, detection evasion, and sophisticated countermeasures
Advanced offensive security techniques and red teaming, particularly on macOS
Developing resilient defensive strategies and proactive security systems
Bridging software development practices with practical cybersecurity solutions

## Interests & Hobbies

Security research (both offensive and defensive perspectives)
Privacy advocacy and technologies
Physical security methodologies
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (embracing the humility of continuous improvement)
Strength training (discipline through consistency)
The endless quest for grilling the perfect steak

## Current Focus
Deep exploration into malware development methodologies and evasion techniques to illuminate modern threat landscapes and strengthen defensive readiness. Echoing Terry Davis's insight: "If you're not breaking something, you're not doing it right."

## Let's Connect

Actually, let's not connect digitally—but if our paths cross at a conference, I'm always eager to exchange ideas and share insights.
